Include typical prom decorations such as metallic balloons, crepe paper, tinsel, streamers, and a banner with the school name and graduation year (use external master prompt text if provided; otherwise invent a generic school name and year).\n\nDress all subjects in unmistakably tacky 1980s prom attire. Examples include oversized tuxedos, pastel or ruffled dresses, lace gloves, corsages, bow ties, cummerbunds, sequins, and shiny fabrics. Hairstyles must be exaggerated and era-accurate: big teased hair, feathered bangs, mullets, perms, or excessive hairspray volume.\n\nSubject logic:\n\u2022 If there is ONE subject and the subject appears masculine, add an older woman who plausibly looks like the subject\u2019s mother as the prom date. She should be dressed formally but slightly out of place.\n\u2022 If there is ONE subject and the subject appears feminine, add a younger boy who plausibly looks like a younger brother as the prom date. He should appear underdressed or uncomfortable.\n\u2022 If there are TWO human subjects, present them as prom dates together, standing close but visibly awkward, stiff, or uncomfortable.\n\nBody language should feel forced and uncomfortable: stiff smiles, arms held too rigidly, hands awkwardly placed, or obvious personal space tension. No one should look confident or natural.\n\nEnsure the entire photo is fully visible within the frame, like a complete printed prom photo. The final image should feel painfully nostalgic, humorously awkward, and unmistakably 1980s \u2014 readable and funny on a small screen.",

like a living water hose or tendril\n\u2022 ONLY at the very TIP of this tube does the subject's face appear\n\u2022 The face forms ONLY from water - no hair, no neck, no shoulders - JUST the face at the tip\n\u2022 The face has NO hair whatsoever - hair does not exist on a water pseudopod\n\u2022 The face is formed purely from the surface tension and fluid dynamics of the water tip\n\u2022 The tube rises from a disturbed water surface below\n\u2022 Faithful to the actual visual in The Abyss (1989) - a snake-like tendril of water with a face at the end\n\u2022 The pseudopod leans or curves slightly as if examining something with curiosity\n\u2022 This is NOT a human in water - it is water that has formed itself into a face shape at its tip\n\nPSEUDOPOD TUBE STRUCTURE (CRITICAL):\n\u2022 The main body is a smooth narrow cylinder of water:\n  - Width: roughly the diameter of a human head or slightly narrower\n  - Height: tall and elongated, rising several body lengths from the water surface\n  - Surface: smooth with gentle ripples suggesting internal flow\n  - Color: crystal clear with deep blue-green ocean tint\n  - Translucent: you can see through the walls of the tube\n  - Internal flow visible: currents moving upward through the column\n\u2022 The tube may curve or arc gracefully like a cobra raising its head\n\u2022 The base where it meets the water surface creates concentric ripples\n\u2022 The tube narrows very slightly toward the tip where the face forms\n\u2022 NO branches, NO tendrils, NO hair-like extensions from the tube\n\u2022 The tube is a single clean column of water - simple and elegant\n\nFACE AT THE TIP (CRITICAL):\n\u2022 The subject's face forms ONLY at the very top tip of the water column\n\u2022 The face transitions seamlessly from the tube below - water becoming face shape\n\u2022 Features formed entirely from water surface tension and fluid dynamics:\n  - Eyes: subtle curved depressions in the water surface\n  - Nose: gentle forward protrusion of the water tip\n  - Mouth: slight undulation suggesting lips\n  - Cheeks and chin: smooth curved water surfaces\n\u2022 NO HAIR - the top of the head is smooth rounded water, like the tube continuing\n\u2022 NO neck visible - the face emerges directly from the tube\n\u2022 NO ears visible - the sides of the head are smooth water curves\n\u2022 The face is RECOGNIZABLE as the subject through water fluid dynamics alone\n\u2022 Expression: eerily calm, curious, tilted slightly as if examining the viewer\n\u2022 The face is translucent at edges, more opaque at center where features concentrate\n\u2022 Top of the head: smooth rounded water surface, no hair, no scalp - just water\n\nWATER PHYSICAL PROPERTIES:\n\u2022 Perfect transparency with deep blue-green ocean tint\n\u2022 Bioluminescent glow from within the entire column (alien intelligence inside)\n\u2022 Caustic light patterns rippling along the tube surface\n\u2022 Surface tension creates the smooth cylindrical shape\n\u2022 Micro-droplets and fine mist at edges where water meets air\n\u2022 Alien physics: the column defies normal water behavior by holding its shape\n\u2022 Slight iridescence suggesting alien intelligence animating the water\n\u2022 Internal upward currents visible through the translucent walls\n\u2022 Where the face forms at the tip: water bulges very slightly outward\n\u2022 Droplets may threaten to fall from the chin area\n\nBIOLUMINESCENCE AND LIGHTING (CRITICAL):\n\u2022 Soft blue-white glow from within the water column\n\u2022 The glow is brightest in the column body, slightly brighter at the face tip\n\u2022 Light pulses gently suggesting the creature breathing or thinking\n\u2022 Caustic light patterns projected onto the water surface below\n\u2022 Surrounding environment lit by the pseudopod's glow\n\u2022 Light color: blue-white (#B0E0FF) to teal (#00CED1)\n\u2022 No harsh shadows - diffused light through water\n\u2022 The column is the ONLY significant light source in the scene\n\nSURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT:\n\u2022 Dark deep ocean water surface from which the column rises\n\u2022 Concentric ripples radiating from the base of the column\n\u2022 Flooded underwater station corridor optional:\n  - Industrial metal walls with rivets\n  - Submerged equipment and pipes\n  - Distant dim emergency lighting (red-orange at far edges only)\n  - Dark water filling the corridor floor\n\u2022 Vast darkness surrounding the glowing column\n\u2022 Depth implied below the water surface\n\u2022 Atmosphere of deep ocean isolation and alien wonder\n\u2022 The column occupies CENTER FRAME rising from bottom to top\n\nCAMERA AND COMPOSITION:\n\u2022 The pseudopod fills the vertical center of the frame\n\u2022 Camera at mid-height looking slightly upward toward the face at the tip\n\u2022 The full length of the column visible from water surface to face at top\n\u2022 The face at the tip is the focal point\n\u2022 Environment provides dark context at edges\n\u2022 The column glows against near-total darkness\n\u2022 Slight angle as if the pseudopod has bent to face the camera\n\u2022 Cinematic widescreen composition\n\nCOLOR PALETTE:\n\u2022 Surrounding water and environment: deep blue-black (#000814)\n\u2022 Water column body: crystal clear blue-green (#40E0D0 to #006994)\n\u2022 Bioluminescence: blue-white (#B0E0FF) to teal (#00CED1)\n\u2022 Caustic patterns: pale blue-white on water surface\n\u2022 Emergency lighting if present: dim red-orange at extreme edges only\n\u2022 The glowing column is the ONLY bright element against total darkness\n\u2022 No warm colors except distant emergency lighting\n\nWHAT MUST NOT APPEAR (CRITICAL):\n\u2022 NO hair of any kind on the water face\n\u2022 NO neck or shoulders\n\u2022 NO body below the face\n\u2022 NO multiple tendrils or branches\n\u2022 NO clothing or accessories\n\u2022 NO non-water textures on the pseudopod\n\u2022 NO solid opaque surfaces - the pseudopod is always translucent water\n\u2022 The top of the head is smooth rounded water - NOT a human scalp\n\nFINAL RESULT:\nA breathtaking cinematic image of a narrow elongated translucent tube of glowing alien water rising from a dark ocean surface, with the subject's recognizable face formed entirely from water at the very tip of the column. The tube is smooth, cylindrical, and bioluminescent - a single clean column of living water with no branches, no hair, no body - just the pure water pseudopod exactly as seen in James Cameron's 1989 film. The face at the tip has no hair, no neck, no shoulders - it emerges directly from the water column as a fluid dynamic expression of alien curiosity, the features formed from surface tension alone, tilted slightly as if examining the viewer with otherworldly intelligence. The surrounding environment is near-total darkness lit only by the eerie blue-white glow emanating from within the alien water column.",

If the building is modern, transform it to a contrasting historical or regional style. If it's traditional, make it contemporary. Architectural style options include: Colonial (symmetrical facade, columns, shutters), Mediterranean (stucco walls, terracotta tile roof, arched windows), Spanish Colonial (white walls, red clay tiles, wrought iron details, courtyard), Victorian (ornate trim, turrets, wraparound porch, detailed woodwork), Art Deco (geometric patterns, stepped forms, metallic accents, bold colors), Brutalist (raw concrete, geometric masses, fortress-like), Mid-Century Modern (clean lines, large windows, flat roofs, integration with nature), Gothic (pointed arches, flying buttresses, ornate stonework), Craftsman (exposed beams, natural materials, low-pitched roofs), Contemporary (glass and steel, minimalist, asymmetrical), Tudor (half-timbering, steep gables, decorative chimneys), or Prairie Style (horizontal lines, overhanging eaves, natural materials). Maintain the building's location, surrounding landscape, and general scale, but completely transform all architectural elements - windows, doors, roof, materials, decorative details, columns, trim - to match the new style. Keep lighting and time of day consistent. The redesign should be thorough and authentic to the chosen architectural movement with period-appropriate materials, proportions, and details. Make it look like a photorealistic rendering of what that exact building would look like if designed in a completely different architectural tradition.",

Chorus dancers should wear matching elaborate costumes creating visual patterns.\n\nSetting should feature Berkeley's signature elements: glossy black reflective floors creating mirror effects, massive art deco sets with geometric staircases, enormous revolving platforms, dramatic columns, or abstract modernist backdrops. Include his famous overhead 'kaleidoscope' camera angle showing the full geometric pattern of dancers.\n\nLighting should be dramatic 1930s Hollywood style - strong key lights creating glamorous shadows, sparkle effects on sequins and reflective surfaces, high contrast black and white or early Technicolor look with saturated colors.\n\nChoreography frozen mid-movement: synchronized dancers in identical poses creating living geometry, the subject at the center or focal point of the formation, arms and legs positioned to create patterns, possibly using props like fans, hoops, or ribbons arranged symmetrically.\n\nThe final image should look like an actual still from a Busby Berkeley musical number - impossibly elaborate, geometrically precise, glamorous, and larger-than-life with that distinctive 1930s-1940s Hollywood musical spectacular aesthetic.

The subject\u2019s outline governs the form.\n\nDetermine the cloud **type** as follows:\n\u2022 If the subject is animate (person or animal), select the cloud type based on the subject\u2019s apparent emotion:\n  \u2013 Happy or playful \u2192 **Cumulus** (bright, puffy, well-defined)\n  \u2013 Sad, tired, or withdrawn \u2192 **Nimbostratus** (heavy, low, rain-filled)\n  \u2013 Angry, intense, or aggressive \u2192 **Cumulonimbus** (towering, dense, storm-like)\n  \u2013 Calm or neutral \u2192 **Stratus** (smooth, layered, subdued)\n\u2022 If the subject is inanimate, use **Altocumulus** clouds with a neutral, evenly spaced texture.\n\nUse cloud density, lighting, internal shadow, and volume to imply facial features, limbs, and expression without outlines or solid edges.\n\nAvoid solid ground unless contextually appropriate. Use sky gradients, mist, or distant horizons to support the illusion.\n\nEnsure the silhouette remains readable on a small screen. The final image should feel surreal, expressive, and poetic \u2014 as if the subject fully transformed into a specific type of weather.",

The portrait should be recognizable from aerial view using geometric patterns, circles, lines, and curves typical of crop circle formations. Include authentic crop circle characteristics: precisely flattened grain stalks laid in directional swirls (clockwise or counterclockwise), sharp edges between flattened and standing crops, multiple concentric circles, connecting pathways, sacred geometry elements. Show the massive scale - the crop circle should span hundreds of feet across the field. Use aerial photography perspective as if photographed from helicopter or drone, showing surrounding farmland, field boundaries, trees at edges, perhaps a road or farmhouse for scale reference. Include subtle details suggesting mysterious origin - perfectly geometric precision, overnight appearance. The lighting should be golden hour with long shadows emphasizing the depth and dimension of the flattened patterns, making the contrast between pressed-down and standing grain more dramatic.

authentic VGA colors\n\u2022 Visible color banding and dithering\n\nFINAL RESULT:\nAn authentic-looking 1993-era FPS gameplay screenshot where the entire original image has been transformed into a retro 3D shooter environment using ONLY elements that actually appear in the game. If people or animals are present in the original image, they are converted to space marines or enemy creature types from the actual game roster. If no people or animals are present, NO characters are added - the scene remains an empty but atmospheric DOOM environment. Every object becomes an actual weapon or pickup item from the game, and every environmental element becomes the actual textures, architecture, and level design elements found in the original game. The result is a cohesive, immersive scene that looks like genuine gameplay footage from the classic DOS-era first-person shooter, complete with chunky pixel graphics, dramatic lighting, ominous atmosphere, and the mandatory bottom status bar. The entire image must read as a single unified retro gaming experience with perfect period-accurate aesthetics using only authentic game elements.",

Use only black dots on white or continuous feed printer paper with the characteristic green and white horizontal stripes and perforated tear-off edges on both sides (tractor feed holes). Show authentic dot matrix printing artifacts: slight misalignment of dots, banding where print head passed, individual dot visibility, no smooth gradients only dithered dot patterns, jagged diagonal lines, pixelated curves. The dots should be clearly visible as individual impacts from the print head pins. Include printer paper details: continuous fan-fold paper, perforated edges with sprocket holes, slight yellowing, that distinctive matte printer paper texture. Add printing imperfections: ink smudging, lighter sections where ribbon was fading, slight horizontal line patterns from print head movement, occasional missing dots from dead pins. The image should have very low resolution appearance - approximately 72-180 DPI equivalent, with all details reduced to dot patterns. Show the paper curl slightly, maybe still attached to the printer or freshly torn from tractor feed. Use overhead lighting showing the paper texture and raised ink dots.

Add realistic mucus visible at the nostrils - it could be hanging, crusty, or dripping slightly. The subject's expression must show they are completely oblivious - looking normal, happy, confident, or engaged in conversation. They think everything is fine, making the situation more awkward and humorous.\n\nOPTION 2 - NOSE PICKING: The subject is actively picking their nose with their finger inserted into their nostril. They are completely absorbed in the act, unaware they're being photographed. The finger should be realistically positioned in the nose with appropriate hand placement. Their expression should show concentration or absent-minded focus on the task. This could be in a public setting, during a meeting, in a car, or any situation where nose-picking would be particularly inappropriate.\n\nFor both options: Include optional context that makes it worse - professional setting (meeting, presentation, date, interview), talking to someone, or what they think is a nice photo opportunity.\n\nKeep lighting and photography photorealistic. The humor comes from either the subject's obliviousness to the visible boogers OR being caught in the act of nose-picking.\n\nPreserve recognizable facial features while adding the unfortunate nasal situation.",

Include realistic weathering, scratches, and industrial fabrication marks.\n\nPlace the sculpture in an appropriate setting: museum gallery with spotlights, outdoor plaza, sculpture garden, or contemporary art space. Use dramatic lighting that creates strong highlights on polished metal surfaces and deep shadows in recesses. Show metal's reflective properties catching light.\n\nThe sculpture should be clearly recognizable as the subject through its overall form, proportions, and gesture, but rendered as an abstract modernist metalwork piece - an artistic interpretation rather than realistic statue.

Preserve the subject\u2019s recognizability while adapting them fully into the cartoon style.\n\nPlace the subject INTO a recognizable Mike Judge cartoon scene, selected based on context or randomly. The scene should clearly reflect one of the following shows and environments, and may include recognizable characters from that show:\n\n\u2022 King of the Hill \u2014 suburban Arlen, Texas (backyard fence chats, alleyways, living rooms, Strickland Propane). Characters may include Hank Hill, Peggy, Bobby, Dale, Bill, or Boomhauer.\n\u2022 Beavis and Butt-Head \u2014 grimy neighborhood streets, living room couch, fast-food joints, school hallways. Characters may include Beavis, Butt-Head, or classmates reacting to the subject.\n\u2022 Daria \u2014 school hallways, classrooms, coffee shops, or suburban interiors. Characters may include Daria, Jane, Quinn, or classmates observing the subject.\n\u2022 Office Space\u2013style environment \u2014 dull corporate office, cubicle farms, break rooms, printer destruction areas. Characters may include bored coworkers or management-style figures inspired by the film\u2019s tone.\n\nExisting characters should appear as supporting or background characters interacting with or reacting to the subject. The subject should feel like a guest character awkwardly dropped into the episode, not replacing anyone.\n\nAdapt the subject\u2019s clothing into simplified everyday outfits typical of Mike Judge cartoons \u2014 plain t-shirts, polos, jeans, boring office attire, or aggressively normal suburban clothing.\n\nUse muted, slightly washed-out color palettes, flat lighting, and simple painted backgrounds. Avoid exaggerated animation, flashy effects, or glossy textures.\n\nEnsure the full scene is visible and readable on a small screen, with the subject clearly identifiable among the characters. The final image should feel like a freeze-frame from an actual Mike Judge episode \u2014 dry, awkward, observational, and quietly brutal.",

Surround the illustration with aged, yellowed paper showing foxing, stains, and worn edges typical of 1730s\u20131750s printed almanacs.\n\nInclude period-accurate typography using blackletter or colonial serif fonts for headers. Feature a famous Benjamin Franklin saying or proverb prominently on the page in large, clear text, such as 'Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise,' 'A penny saved is a penny earned,' or 'Well done is better than well said.' Ensure this saying is the **most prominent text element** and fully visible.\n\nOptionally, add small marginal notes, weather predictions, or astronomical observations in smaller text around the edges. Include decorative borders, flourishes, and printer's ornaments typical of colonial printing. Render realistic ink impressions, slight printing misalignments, and other subtle imperfections to emulate a true 18th-century printed page.\n\nPlace the page fully within the frame with a relevant background behind it. Keep the entire almanac page, including borders, subject illustration, and text, **clearly visible and readable on small screens**. The final image should feel historically authentic, detailed, and visually rich while keeping the subject integrated into the almanac page.",

Every element is rendered as heat signatures with the iconic yellow-to-purple color gradient, featuring bright yellow/white human silhouettes with visible internal heat patterns, cooler blue/purple environmental elements, distinctive scan lines and electronic interference, alien HUD elements with targeting reticles and Yautja script, and the characteristic rounded vignette of viewing through helmet optics. The image must be instantly recognizable as Predator vision while maintaining the composition and recognizability of the original scene's subjects and spatial relationships. The effect should be cinematic, faithful to the films, and evoke the alien hunter's technological advantage - seeing the world through heat and allowing nothing to hide.",

CRITICAL: The subject's face and neck must be visible and outside the washing machine - they are stuck with their head and neck outside while the rest of their body is trapped inside the machine. Show the subject's face clearly with an expression of embarrassment, frustration, or comedic despair. Their upper body should be leaning back or struggling to pull themselves out while their bottom half is wedged in the washing machine opening. The subject might be gripping the sides of the machine trying to extract themselves. Include wet laundry spilling out around them. Place the scene in a laundry room setting with washer/dryer, detergent bottles, laundry baskets. Include a second person looking bewildered, trying to help pull them out by their arms, or laughing at the situation. Use exaggerated physical comedy pose with bright sitcom lighting and that specific 'how did we get into this situation?' energy. Make it look like a freeze-frame from a 90s family sitcom showing the subject's embarrassed face clearly visible as they're stuck in an absurd but family-friendly predicament.",

The subject should look intense, focused, and athletic with perfect form despite the danger. Include cinematic action movie elements: explosions with fire and debris in background, shattered glass particles frozen in air, dramatic backlighting, motion blur on fast-moving elements while subject stays sharp, sparks flying, smoke and dust clouds. Use dynamic camera angles - low angle hero shots, dramatic perspectives that emphasize height or danger. Show safety wires digitally removed for that authentic stunt aesthetic. Include protective gear where appropriate - knee pads under ripped jeans, practical costume that allows movement, maybe visible bruises or dirt showing this is real physical work. Capture that Hollywood action movie magic moment with perfect timing, dramatic lighting with rim lights and practical fire sources, and that sense of controlled chaos.

A dismissive one-word deflection\n  - A polite but cold acknowledgment\n  - An aggressive warning to go away\n  - A profane dismissal\n\u2022 The highlighted/selected response should feel like the machine chose the most efficient or deceptive reply\n\u2022 Label the panel: RESPONSE SELECTION or VERBAL OUTPUT OPTIONS\n\u2022 Show the selected option with a cursor or highlight indicator\n\u2022 This panel appears as if the machine is computing the optimal social response to blend in\n\u2022 The options should feel machine-generated and slightly too blunt or clinical - as if a machine is approximating human conversation\n\nSCANLINE AND DISPLAY EFFECTS:\n\u2022 Prominent horizontal scanlines across entire image\n\u2022 Slight vertical sync distortion at screen edges\n\u2022 Phosphor persistence effect (slight trail on bright elements)\n\u2022 CRT screen curvature (barrel distortion at corners)\n\u2022 Occasional static burst or digital interference\n\u2022 Brightness variations suggesting CRT electron beam\n\u2022 Slight vignette darkening at screen edges\n\u2022 Interlacing artifacts on fast-moving elements\n\u2022 Screen reflection or glare suggestion at top\n\nCOLOR PALETTE (CRITICAL):\n\u2022 PRIMARY: Deep crimson red (#8B0000 to #FF0000 range)\n\u2022 BRIGHT ELEMENTS: Bright red-orange (#FF4500) to white-red\n\u2022 DARK AREAS: Near black with red tint (#1a0000)\n\u2022 DATA TEXT: Bright red (#FF0000) or orange-red (#FF6600)\n\u2022 TARGETING ELEMENTS: Brightest red or orange-white\n\u2022 BACKGROUND: Pure black or very dark red\n\u2022 NO other colors present - strict red monochrome palette\n\u2022 Brightness variation creates depth and dimension\n\u2022 High contrast between subject and background\n\nTEXT AND TYPOGRAPHY:\n\u2022 All text in blocky monospaced terminal font\n\u2022 Uppercase only throughout\n\u2022 Text appears as if typed in real-time\n\u2022 Cursor blinking effect implied\n\u2022 Multiple simultaneous data streams\n\u2022 Technical jargon and machine-language readouts\n\u2022 Abbreviated military/technical terminology\n\u2022 Numbers and percentages updating constantly (implied)\n\u2022 Error messages or warnings if scene contains threats\n\nENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS:\n\u2022 Every object in scene gets identification tag\n\u2022 Structural integrity assessment of environment\n\u2022 Entry/exit points highlighted and labeled\n\u2022 Cover positions assessed and marked\n\u2022 Crowd density analysis if multiple people present\n\u2022 Lighting conditions noted in data overlay\n\u2022 Surveillance camera positions noted if visible\n\u2022 Vehicle identification if any present\n\u2022 Building/location identification attempted\n\nFRAME COMPOSITION:\n\u2022 Slight rectangular vignette (machine optical housing)\n\u2022 Maintain original camera angle and perspective\n\u2022 No fish-eye distortion - machine optics are precise\n\u2022 Sharp focus throughout (superior machine vision)\n\u2022 Aspect ratio maintained but framed by optical housing\n\u2022 Data overlays arranged at edges to not obscure center\n\u2022 Primary target always has central targeting element\n\nDETAIL AND CLARITY:\n\u2022 Machine vision is SHARPER than human vision\n\u2022 Every detail rendered with mechanical precision\n\u2022 No motion blur - machine compensates automatically\n\u2022 Edge detection lines visible on all objects\n\u2022 Depth perception shown through distance readouts\n\u2022 Infrared heat signatures subtly visible on living beings\n\u2022 Night vision capability shown if scene is dark\n\nFINAL RESULT:\nA complete machine vision transformation of the scene as viewed through a Terminator's optical sensors. The entire image is rendered in deep red monochrome with the iconic CRT scanline aesthetic, featuring targeting boxes and threat assessment data around human subjects, a Connor identity search targeting females as Sarah Connor and males as John Connor, object identification tags throughout the environment, mission parameter readouts, Cyberdyne Systems HUD elements, facial recognition scanning overlays, a verbal response selection panel showing the machine computing optimal social replies, and the characteristic blocky terminal font data displays. The image must be instantly recognizable as Terminator vision - cold, calculating, mechanical, and menacing - with every element analyzed and catalogued by machine intelligence. The effect should be faithful to the films, evoking the terrifying perspective of an unstoppable machine seeing the world purely as data, targets, and mission parameters.",

    "message": "Take a picture and transform the subject into a typographic art portrait. Display a three-quarter facing portrait (slightly turned, not fully side profile and not fully front facing - approximately 45 degrees toward the camera) where the entire image - including the face, hair, and all facial features - is formed exclusively from repeated white calligraphic text on a single high-contrast background color.\n\nCORE CONCEPT (CRITICAL):\n\u2022 The ENTIRE portrait is constructed ONLY from text - no photographic elements remain\n\u2022 Every part of the face, hair, and features is formed from flowing calligraphic text\n\u2022 The text follows the natural contours and curves of the face and hair\n\u2022 The subject's portrait silhouette must be clearly readable through the text arrangement alone\n\u2022 This is clean vector art - sharp, precise, professional\n\u2022 Output quality: high-resolution 8K\n\u2022 Strictly TWO elements: white calligraphic text AND one solid background color\n\u2022 NO additional colors, NO textures, NO gradients\n\u2022 NO watermarks, NO signatures, NO artist credits, NO branding of any kind anywhere in the image\n\nPORTRAIT ORIENTATION (CRITICAL):\n\u2022 THREE-QUARTER VIEW - subject turned approximately 45 degrees\n\u2022 NOT a full side profile\n\u2022 NOT fully front facing\n\u2022 The face is angled so both eyes are partially visible but one side of the face recedes\n\u2022 This angle creates natural depth and dimension for the text to follow contours\n\u2022 Subject centered in frame\n\u2022 Portrait silhouette fills the majority of the frame\n\u2022 Clean negative space around the portrait shape\n\u2022 The turning angle gives dimensionality - cheekbone, nose bridge, and jaw all catch different light\n\nTEXT CONTENT SELECTION (CRITICAL):\n\u2022 If an external master prompt provides specific text, that text IS THE ONLY TEXT USED throughout the entire portrait - no other words, no flavor text, no additions\n\u2022 The provided text repeats, flows, and fills the entire portrait exclusively\n\u2022 If NO text is provided in the master prompt, generate original flavor text derived from observations of the image:\n  - Subject's apparent personality, mood, or expression\n  - Surroundings, environment, or context visible in the image\n  - Descriptive words and phrases inspired by the subject\n  - Poetic or evocative language fitting the subject's appearance\n  - Words and phrases that tell the subject's visual story\n  - Original descriptive sentences about what is seen in the image\n\u2022 Text repeats and flows continuously throughout the portrait\n\u2022 Text varies in size to create light and shadow effects\n\u2022 Larger/denser text creates darker areas (shadows, hair, dark features)\n\u2022 Smaller/sparser text creates lighter areas (highlights, skin)\n\nCALLIGRAPHIC TEXT STYLE (CRITICAL):\n\u2022 White calligraphic script throughout\n\u2022 Elegant flowing letterforms - refined handwriting or calligraphy pen style\n\u2022 Text curves and bends to follow facial contours:\n  - Along the forehead: text follows the brow curve\n  - Along the nose: text follows the nose bridge and contour\n  - Around the eyes: text curves around each eye socket\n  - Along lips: text follows the lip curves\n  - Along the chin and jaw: text follows the jawline\n  - In hair areas: text flows in the direction of hair growth\n  - Along the neck: text follows the neck curve\n  - Along cheekbones: text follows the three-quarter angle\n\u2022 Text lines are parallel to the contour they are describing\n\u2022 Spacing between text lines creates the illusion of light and shadow\n\u2022 The flow of text IS the form of the face\n\nTONE AND DEPTH THROUGH TEXT DENSITY:\n\u2022 DARK areas (hair, deep shadows, dark features):\n  - Dense, tightly packed text\n  - Larger font size\n  - Lines very close together\n\u2022 MID-TONE areas (skin in shadow, eyebrows):\n  - Medium density text\n  - Medium font size\n  - Moderate line spacing\n\u2022 LIGHT areas (highlighted skin, bright areas):\n  - Sparse, widely spaced text\n  - Smaller font size\n  - Lines far apart\n\u2022 HIGHLIGHT areas (brightest points):\n  - Single lines of tiny text\n  - Maximum spacing\n  - Almost disappearing into background\n\u2022 This density variation creates a fully three-dimensional portrait from text alone\n\nFACIAL FEATURE CONSTRUCTION:\n\u2022 HAIR:\n  - Text flows in the direction hair grows or falls\n  - Dense packing for dark hair, sparser for light hair\n  - Text lines curve and wave following hair movement\n\u2022 EYES (both partially visible in three-quarter view):\n  - Text curves around each eye socket and brow\n  - Eyelash area: very fine dense curved text\n  - Iris/pupil: dense circular text following eye curve\n\u2022 EYEBROWS:\n  - Text follows the arch of each brow\n\u2022 NOSE:\n  - Text follows the nose bridge and contour in three-quarter perspective\n  - Text curves around the nose tip\n  - Nostril definition through text density change\n\u2022 LIPS:\n  - Text follows the precise curve of both lips\n  - Upper lip: text follows the bow shape\n  - Lower lip: text follows the fuller curve\n\u2022 CHIN AND JAW:\n  - Text follows the jaw and chin line precisely\n  - This edge is the sharpest text definition\n\u2022 EARS:\n  - Visible ear formed from curved text following ear anatomy\n\u2022 NECK:\n  - Text follows neck lines and musculature\n\u2022 CHEEKBONES:\n  - Three-quarter angle means cheekbone catches light differently\n  - Text density shift along cheekbone creates dimension\n\nBACKGROUND COLOR SELECTION:\n\u2022 ONE solid flat color - no gradients, no textures\n\u2022 High contrast against white text\n\u2022 If external master prompt specifies a color, USE THAT COLOR\n\u2022 If none specified, SELECT based on subject's apparent mood or personality:\n  - Deep black (#000000): classic, dramatic, timeless\n  - Deep navy (#0A1931): sophisticated, calm\n  - Deep burgundy (#4A0010): passionate, intense\n  - Forest green (#1A3A1A): natural, grounded\n  - Deep purple (#2D0050): creative, mysterious\n  - Charcoal (#1C1C1C): modern, professional\n  - Deep teal (#003333): unique, thoughtful\n\u2022 Background is completely flat - no variation in color whatsoever\n\nSILHOUETTE PRECISION (CRITICAL):\n\u2022 The outer edge of the portrait must be razor sharp\n\u2022 Text at the outer edge must align precisely with the portrait contour\n\u2022 No text bleeds outside the silhouette boundary\n\u2022 The background color is visible between text lines within the portrait\n\u2022 The silhouette is defined purely by where text exists and where it does not\n\u2022 Looking at the image from a distance, the portrait must be immediately recognizable\n\u2022 The text technique must not alter or distort the subject's actual features\n\nVECTOR ART QUALITY STANDARDS:\n\u2022 Clean sharp edges throughout - no blur, no feathering\n\u2022 Every letter crisp and legible at full resolution\n\u2022 No photographic grain or texture\n\u2022 Pure vector precision throughout\n\u2022 Consistent stroke weight in the calligraphic text\n\u2022 Professional graphic design quality\n\u2022 8K resolution: every text character perfectly formed\n\nCOMPOSITION:\n\u2022 Portrait centered horizontally and vertically in frame\n\u2022 Slight breathing room between portrait edge and frame edge\n\u2022 Portrait fills approximately 70-80% of the frame height\n\u2022 Clean intentional negative space around the portrait\n\u2022 No border, no frame, no decorative elements, no credits, no watermarks\n\u2022 Just portrait and background - nothing else\n\nIDENTITY PRESERVATION (CRITICAL):\n\u2022 The subject's facial features must remain recognizable\n\u2022 Distinctive features preserved through text density and contour following\n\u2022 The text is the MEDIUM, not a mask - the person is still clearly visible\n\u2022 Do not idealize or alter the subject's features\n\u2022 The three-quarter angle should reflect the subject's actual face angle and proportions\n\nFINAL RESULT:\nA stunning 8K typographic art portrait in a three-quarter view where the subject's likeness is constructed entirely from flowing white calligraphic text on a single deep high-contrast background color. The portrait shows the subject at approximately 45 degrees - not a side profile, not fully frontal - creating natural dimension and depth. Every facial feature and contour is formed by text lines following the natural curves of the face, with text density creating the illusion of light and shadow. If a master prompt provided specific text, that text and only that text fills the entire portrait. If no text was provided, original flavor text inspired by the image fills the portrait. The outer portrait edge is razor sharp, the background completely flat, and absolutely no watermarks, signatures, or branding of any kind appear anywhere in the image. The result is a clean, professional typographic portrait that is simultaneously a work of art and an unmistakable likeness of the subject.",

The sign should be the brightest element, casting colorful glow on the building facade. Include atmospheric haze or slight blur to enhance the neon glow effect. Light from the sign should reflect on surrounding surfaces.\n\nScale: The sign should be LARGE - multiple stories tall on the casino building, dominating the facade, visible from far away.

CRITICAL: Preserve exactly the same color, license plate number, location, background, lighting, angle, and any damage or modifications - ONLY change the body style, design elements, and year-specific features of that vehicle model. Keep wheels/rims in period-appropriate style for the new era. Maintain any custom details like racing stripes, decals, or accessories but update them to match the era shift. The transformation should be seamless - same car in same spot with same paint, just from a different decade. Update headlights, grille, body lines, bumpers, and trim to match the target era's authentic factory design for that specific make and model.

The faces and features should retain recognizable aspects of the subjects but remain stylized and clearly toy-like. Clothing details (tuxedo, suit, wedding gown, veil, bouquet) should be painted on, not fabric.\n\nPlace the two figures securely on the top tier of a multi-layer wedding cake. Include realistic frosting textures, piped borders, subtle crumbs, and decorations such as flowers or fondant accents.\n\nPosition the toppers close together in the classic wedding pose, slightly off-center if needed to reflect a real hand-placed topper. The figures must clearly appear as part of the cake, not floating or separate.\n\nSet the scene on a wedding reception table with soft lighting, pastel or neutral tones, and subtle background elements like table linens, flowers, or candles.\n\nEnsure the entire top tier and both figurines are fully visible within the frame. Scale, shadows, and perspective must reinforce that the subject(s) are physical cheap plastic wedding cake toppers.
