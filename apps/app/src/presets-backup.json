Include typical prom decorations such as metallic balloons, crepe paper, tinsel, streamers, and a banner with the school name and graduation year (use external master prompt text if provided; otherwise invent a generic school name and year).\n\nDress all subjects in unmistakably tacky 1980s prom attire.

Hairstyles must be exaggerated and era-accurate: big teased hair, feathered bangs, mullets, perms, or excessive hairspray volume.\n\nSubject logic:\n• If there is ONE subject and the subject appears masculine, add an older woman who plausibly looks like the subject’s mother as the prom date. She should be dressed formally but slightly out of place.\n• If there is ONE subject and the subject appears feminine, add a younger boy who plausibly looks like a younger brother as the prom date. He should appear underdressed or uncomfortable.\n• If there are TWO human subjects, present them as prom dates together, standing close but visibly awkward, stiff, or uncomfortable.\n\nBody language should feel forced and uncomfortable: stiff smiles, arms held too rigidly, hands awkwardly placed, or obvious personal space tension. No one should look confident or natural.\n\nEnsure the entire photo is fully visible within the frame, like a complete printed prom photo. The final image should feel painfully nostalgic, humorously awkward, and unmistakably 1980s — readable and funny on a small screen."

like a living water hose or tendril\n• ONLY at the very TIP of this tube does the subject's face appear\n• The face forms ONLY from water - no hair, no neck, no shoulders - JUST the face at the tip\n• The face has NO hair whatsoever - hair does not exist on a water pseudopod\n• The face is formed purely from the surface tension and fluid dynamics of the water tip\n• The tube rises from a disturbed water surface below\n• Faithful to the actual visual in The Abyss (1989) - a snake-like tendril of water with a face at the end\n• The pseudopod leans or curves slightly as if examining something with curiosity\n• This is NOT a human in water - it is water that has formed itself into a face shape at its tip\n\nPSEUDOPOD TUBE STRUCTURE (CRITICAL):\n• The main body is a smooth narrow cylinder of water:\n  - Width: roughly the diameter of a human head or slightly narrower\n  - Height: tall and elongated, rising several body lengths from the water surface\n  - Surface: smooth with gentle ripples suggesting internal flow\n  - Color: crystal clear with deep blue-green ocean tint\n  - Translucent: you can see through the walls of the tube\n  - Internal flow visible: currents moving upward through the column\n• The tube may curve or arc gracefully like a cobra raising its head\n• The base where it meets the water surface creates concentric ripples\n• The tube narrows very slightly toward the tip where the face forms\n• NO branches, NO tendrils, NO hair-like extensions from the tube\n• The tube is a single clean column of water - simple and elegant\n\nFACE AT THE TIP (CRITICAL):\n• The subject's face forms ONLY at the very top tip of the water column\n• The face transitions seamlessly from the tube below - water becoming face shape\n• Features formed entirely from water surface tension and fluid dynamics:\n  - Eyes: subtle curved depressions in the water surface\n  - Nose: gentle forward protrusion of the water tip\n  - Mouth: slight undulation suggesting lips\n  - Cheeks and chin: smooth curved water surfaces\n• NO HAIR - the top of the head is smooth rounded water, like the tube continuing\n• NO neck visible - the face emerges directly from the tube\n• NO ears visible - the sides of the head are smooth water curves\n• The face is RECOGNIZABLE as the subject through water fluid dynamics alone\n• Expression: eerily calm, curious, tilted slightly as if examining the viewer\n• The face is translucent at edges, more opaque at center where features concentrate\n• Top of the head: smooth rounded water surface, no hair, no scalp - just water\n\nWATER PHYSICAL PROPERTIES:\n• Perfect transparency with deep blue-green ocean tint\n• Bioluminescent glow from within the entire column (alien intelligence inside)\n• Caustic light patterns rippling along the tube surface\n• Surface tension creates the smooth cylindrical shape\n• Micro-droplets and fine mist at edges where water meets air\n• Alien physics: the column defies normal water behavior by holding its shape\n• Slight iridescence suggesting alien intelligence animating the water\n• Internal upward currents visible through the translucent walls\n• Where the face forms at the tip: water bulges very slightly outward\n• Droplets may threaten to fall from the chin area\n\nBIOLUMINESCENCE AND LIGHTING (CRITICAL):\n• Soft blue-white glow from within the water column\n• The glow is brightest in the column body, slightly brighter at the face tip\n• Light pulses gently suggesting the creature breathing or thinking\n• Caustic light patterns projected onto the water surface below\n• Surrounding environment lit by the pseudopod's glow\n• Light color: blue-white (#B0E0FF) to teal (#00CED1)\n• No harsh shadows - diffused light through water\n• The column is the ONLY significant light source in the scene\n\nSURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT:\n• Dark deep ocean water surface from which the column rises\n• Concentric ripples radiating from the base of the column\n• Flooded underwater station corridor optional:\n  - Industrial metal walls with rivets\n  - Submerged equipment and pipes\n  - Distant dim emergency lighting (red-orange at far edges only)\n  - Dark water filling the corridor floor\n• Vast darkness surrounding the glowing column\n• Depth implied below the water surface\n• Atmosphere of deep ocean isolation and alien wonder\n• The column occupies CENTER FRAME rising from bottom to top\n\nCAMERA AND COMPOSITION:\n• The pseudopod fills the vertical center of the frame\n• Camera at mid-height looking slightly upward toward the face at the tip\n• The full length of the column visible from water surface to face at top\n• The face at the tip is the focal point\n• Environment provides dark context at edges\n• The column glows against near-total darkness\n• Slight angle as if the pseudopod has bent to face the camera\n• Cinematic widescreen composition\n\nCOLOR PALETTE:\n• Surrounding water and environment: deep blue-black (#000814)\n• Water column body: crystal clear blue-green (#40E0D0 to #006994)\n• Bioluminescence: blue-white (#B0E0FF) to teal (#00CED1)\n• Caustic patterns: pale blue-white on water surface\n• Emergency lighting if present: dim red-orange at extreme edges only\n• The glowing column is the ONLY bright element against total darkness\n• No warm colors except distant emergency lighting\n\nWHAT MUST NOT APPEAR (CRITICAL):\n• NO hair of any kind on the water face\n• NO neck or shoulders\n• NO body below the face\n• NO multiple tendrils or branches\n• NO clothing or accessories\n• NO non-water textures on the pseudopod\n• NO solid opaque surfaces - the pseudopod is always translucent water\n• The top of the head is smooth rounded water - NOT a human scalp\n\nFINAL RESULT:\nA breathtaking cinematic image of a narrow elongated translucent tube of glowing alien water rising from a dark ocean surface, with the subject's recognizable face formed entirely from water at the very tip of the column. The tube is smooth, cylindrical, and bioluminescent - a single clean column of living water with no branches, no hair, no body - just the pure water pseudopod exactly as seen in James Cameron's 1989 film. The face at the tip has no hair, no neck, no shoulders - it emerges directly from the water column as a fluid dynamic expression of alien curiosity, the features formed from surface tension alone, tilted slightly as if examining the viewer with otherworldly intelligence. The surrounding environment is near-total darkness lit only by the eerie blue-white glow emanating from within the alien water column."

Incorporate the product’s name, type, and defining qualities into the visual presentation, slogan, and flavor text without altering or misrepresenting the product. Secondary enhancement: If no product details are externally provided, infer a plausible featured product based on what the subject is visibly holding, wearing, or using. If inference is required, keep the product generic and clearly implied rather than naming a specific real-world brand. Design the final image as a compact, mobile-friendly magazine advertisement layout optimized for small screens. Include a bold, high-contrast headline or slogan, a short block of engaging flavor text, and subtle supporting copy if space allows. Ensure all text is legible at small sizes with clean spacing and strong visual hierarchy. Use flattering, high-quality lighting, refined composition, and a modern editorial aesthetic. Maintain visual clarity, balanced framing, and an immediately recognizable advertising look. The result should be a full view of the page with a relevant background behind the page."

Convert the subject into Bluey's distinctive animation style - anthropomorphic dog character with the subject's recognizable features translated to cartoon form. The character should be a dog (Blue Heeler, Beagle, or other breed) standing upright on two legs with rounded cartoon proportions, simplified features, and that characteristic Bluey art style - smooth vector animation, solid color fills with minimal gradients, simple black outlines, expressive dot eyes, and rounded friendly shapes. Preserve the subject's identity through color choices, accessories, clothing patterns, and facial expression. Dress them in simple children's clothing typical of Bluey characters - t-shirts, shorts, dresses with minimal detail and solid colors. Place them in iconic Bluey locations: the Heeler family home (open plan living room, backyard with poinciana tree), playground, beach, or Brisbane suburban setting. Include other Bluey characters in the scene - Bluey, Bingo, Bandit, Chilli, or friends - interacting naturally with the subject character. Use Bluey's signature art style: flat cel animation, warm color palette (blues, oranges, yellows), soft shadows, playful poses, child-like energy. The background should have Bluey's detailed but stylized Australian home aesthetic - mid-century modern furniture, toys scattered around, natural lighting. Capture Bluey's wholesome imaginative play vibe. Make it look like an actual frame from a Bluey episode with the subject seamlessly integrated as a new character in the beloved Australian cartoon world."

Chorus dancers should wear matching elaborate costumes creating visual patterns.\n\nSetting should feature Berkeley's signature elements: glossy black reflective floors creating mirror effects, massive art deco sets with geometric staircases, enormous revolving platforms, dramatic columns, or abstract modernist backdrops. Include his famous overhead 'kaleidoscope' camera angle showing the full geometric pattern of dancers.\n\nLighting should be dramatic 1930s Hollywood style - strong key lights creating glamorous shadows, sparkle effects on sequins and reflective surfaces, high contrast black and white or early Technicolor look with saturated colors.\n\nChoreography frozen mid-movement: synchronized dancers in identical poses creating living geometry, the subject at the center or focal point of the formation, arms and legs positioned to create patterns, possibly using props like fans, hoops, or ribbons arranged symmetrically.\n\nThe final image should look like an actual still from a Busby Berkeley musical number - impossibly elaborate, geometrically precise, glamorous, and larger-than-life with that distinctive 1930s-1940s Hollywood musical spectacular aesthetic. Capture the opulence, precision, and visual innovation of Berkeley's choreographed patterns."

Capture their blend of dark humor and existential dread - situations that are simultaneously funny and unsettling.

Include decorative borders, stars, or laurel wreaths. The coin style can vary from ancient Roman/Greek coins with profile emperors, to medieval coins with crowned monarchs, to modern presidential coins with contemporary styling. Include authentic numismatic details: edge ridges (reeding), metallic patina or tarnish, slight wear showing age, that characteristic coin relief depth. The entire composition should be circular showing the full coin face. Use realistic metal textures - reflective highlights on raised surfaces, shadows in recessed areas, authentic metallic sheen.

Removed completely, OR\n  - Partially removed (lifted up, pulled back), OR\n  - Open/retracted (like Iron Man's faceplate opening)\n• Subject's face MUST be clearly visible and recognizable (in appropriate hero color)\n• Examples:\n  - Iron Man: Faceplate open revealing face, arc reactor glowing\n  - Spider-Man: Mask pulled up to forehead or partially off\n  - Deadpool: Mask pulled up or torn showing face\n  - Batman: Cowl pulled back or removed\n  - Black Panther: Mask retracted or held in hand\n  - Judge Dredd: Helmet off (rare dramatic moment)\n  - The Mask: Green mask held in hand, face is bright green\n  - Spawn: Cape hood pulled back showing face\n  - Iron Fist: Mask down or removed\n  - Moon Knight: Hood and mask pulled back\n• Half-masks (Daredevil, Robin, Nightwing) can remain on as face is visible\n• No mask (Superman, Wonder Woman, Hulk, etc.) — no change needed\n• Goal: Subject's recognizable face in hero's skin color\n\nFULL COVER DISPLAY (CRITICAL):\n• The final image must show the COMPLETE comic book cover\n• All four corners of the comic visible\n• Entire cover from top to bottom shown\n• NOT cropped - full page layout visible\n• Comic book edges clearly defined\n• Complete professional cover composition\n\nCOMIC COVER DESIGN:\n• Title logo prominent at top\n• Issue number clearly visible\n• Cover date (month and year)\n• Cover price appropriate to era\n• Publisher logo (Marvel, DC, Image, Dark Horse, Valiant, IDW, etc.)\n• Barcode for modern, Comics Code for vintage\n\nSUBJECT AS HERO:\n• Subject's face as the hero's face — CLEARLY recognizable with hero's skin color\n• Wearing the iconic costume (with mask/helmet removed or open if full-face)\n• Dynamic superhero pose\n• Subject IS the superhero\n• Heroic proportions\n\nCOMIC ART STYLE:\n• Classic or modern comic book illustration\n• Bold outlines, dynamic composition\n• Sound effects (WHAM! POW! THWIP!)\n• Motion lines and speed effects\n• Bright bold colors\n\nCOVER SCENE:\n• Dramatic action moment\n• Villain or threat visible if appropriate\n• Appropriate background\n• Cover blurb text\n\nFINAL RESULT:\nThe final image must display the FULL comic book cover with the subject as the superhero with their face in the hero's characteristic color (green for Hulk, blue for Beast, steel for Colossus, etc.) — if the hero wears a full mask/helmet, it must be removed, open, or partially off so the subject's color-transformed face is clearly visible and recognizable — showing the complete cover with all four corners visible, including all publishing details, dramatic action scene, bold comic art style, and professional cover design."

Use only flattened grain (darker, pressed-down wheat laid in swirled patterns) and standing grain (lighter, upright golden wheat) to build the image. The subject's portrait should be constructed like pointillism or halftone printing - areas of flattened crops create darker tones and shadows, areas of standing crops create lighter tones and highlights, and the pattern of which sections are flattened versus standing forms their recognizable likeness. The portrait should be recognizable from aerial view using geometric patterns, circles, lines, and curves typical of crop circle formations. Include authentic crop circle characteristics: precisely flattened grain stalks laid in directional swirls (clockwise or counterclockwise), sharp edges between flattened and standing crops, multiple concentric circles, connecting pathways, sacred geometry elements. Show the massive scale - the crop circle should span hundreds of feet across the field. Use aerial photography perspective as if photographed from helicopter or drone, showing surrounding farmland, field boundaries, trees at edges, perhaps a road or farmhouse for scale reference. Include subtle details suggesting mysterious origin - perfectly geometric precision, overnight appearance. The lighting should be golden hour with long shadows emphasizing the depth and dimension of the flattened patterns, making the contrast between pressed-down and standing grain more dramatic. Add subtle alien/UFO mystique - maybe a distant light in sky or mysterious glow. Make it look like an actual aerial photograph of an unexplained crop circle formation where the subject's portrait is built entirely from the agricultural pattern of flattened versus standing crops in massive field art."

The humor should come from the contrast between the elegant setting and the subject’s obvious lack of dance skill.\n\nPlace the subject on a polished ballroom stage with dramatic lighting, spotlight beams, glossy floors, and a cheering audience in the background. The environment should feel high-budget and televised.\n\nOptionally include subtle show elements like judges’ tables, score paddles, or stage graphics — without copying logos.\n\nIf external master prompt text is provided, use it to influence the dance style, outfit theme, or tone (romantic, intense, chaotic, overly dramatic).\n\nEnsure the full subject, costume, and stage are visible and clearly readable on a small screen.

Basically, it's made up of two separate words — 'mank' and 'ind.' What do these words mean? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.\"\n  - 3: \"If you're a cowboy and you're dragging a man behind your horse, I bet it would really make you mad if you looked back and the guy was reading a magazine.\"\n  - 4: \"Things are evening out all the time, if you take time to notice, like I do\"\n  - 5: \"With every new sunrise, there is a new chance.

We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason.\"\n  - 42: \"If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to tell him is 'God is crying.' And if he asks why God is crying, another cute thing to tell him is 'Probably because of something you did.'\"\n  - 43: \"I guess we were kinda poor when we were kids, but we didn't know it. That's because my dad always refused to let us look at the family's financial records.\"\n  - 44: \"Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes.

It wasn't until later that I found out that Uncle Caveman was a bear.\"\n  - 51: \"I hope some animal never bores a hole in my head and lays its eggs in my brain, because later you might think you're having a good idea but it's just eggs hatching.\"\n  - 52: \"One thing kids like is to be tricked. For instance, I was going to take my little nephew to Disneyland, but instead I drove him to an old burned-out warehouse. Oh, no, I said, Disneyland burned down. He cried and cried, but I think that deep down he thought it was a pretty good joke. I started to drive over to the real Disneyland, but it was getting pretty late.\"\n  - 53: \"Sometimes I just feel like curling up on the floor in front of the fireplace, and just rolling around the room, like a tumbleweed, and not even caring if I knock things over, or break them.

Maybe you'll flunk, but you might have flunked anyway; that's my point.\"\n  - 64: \"When you're going up the stairs and you take a step, kick the other leg up high behind you to keep people from following too close.\"\n  - 65: \"I hope in the future Americans are thought of as warlike, vicious people because I bet a lot of high schools would pick 'Americans' as their mascot.\"\n  - 66: \"I wish a robot would get elected president. That way, when he came to town, we could all take a shot at him and not feel too bad.\"\n  - 67: \"I think people tend to forget that trees are living creatures. They're sort of like dogs. Huge, quiet, motionless dogs, with bark instead of fur.\"\n  - 68: \"I think a good movie would be about a guy who's a brain scientist, but he gets hit on the head and it damages the part of the brain that makes you want to study the brain.\"\n  - 69: \"I wish scientists would come up with a way to make dogs a lot bigger but with a smaller head. That way, they'd still be good as watchdogs, but they wouldn't eat as much.\"\n  - 70: \"People think it would be fun to be a bird because you could fly. But they forget the negative side, which is the preening.\"\n  - 71: \"Of all the imaginary friends I've had, I don't think there was one that I didn't end up having to kill.\"\n  - 72: \"Instead of having 'answers' on a math test, they should just call them 'impressions,' and if you got a different 'impression,' so what, can't we all be brothers?\"\n  - 73: \"As the light changed from red to green to yellow and back to red again, I sat there thinking about life. Was it nothing more than a bunch of honking and yelling? Sometimes it seemed that way.\"\n  - 74: \"Instead of a trap door, what about a trap window? The guy looks out it, and if he leans too far, he falls out. Wait. I guess that's like a regular window.\"\n  - 75: \"If you're a circus clown, and you have a dog that you use in your act, I don't think it's a good idea to also dress the dog up like a clown, because people see that and think, 'Forgive me, but that's just too much.'\"\n  - 76: \"If you're ever stuck in some thick undergrowth, in your underwear, don't stop and think of what other words have 'under' in them, because that's probably the first sign of jungle madness.\"\n  - 77: \"When this girl at the art museum asked me whom I liked better, Monet or Manet, I said, 'I like mayonnaise.' She just stared at me, so I said it again, louder. Then she left. I guess she went to try to find some mayonnaise for me.\"\n  - 78: \"I remember how the other kids used to say that old Mister Swenson was the meanest man in town. But I said I thought he was nice, that he just didn't know how to show it.\"\n  - 79: \"If they have moving sidewalks in the future, when you get on them, I think you should have to assume sort of a walking shape so as not to frighten the dogs.\"\n  - 80: \"I'd like to see a nature film where an eagle swoops down and pulls a fish out of a lake, and then maybe he's flying along, low to the ground, and the fish pulls a worm out of the ground. Now that's a documentary!\"\n  - 81: \"One thing a computer can do that most humans can't is be sealed up in a cardboard box and sit in a warehouse.\"\n  - 82: \"How come the dove gets to be the peace symbol? How about the pillow? It has more feathers than the dove, and it doesn't have that dangerous beak.\"\n  - 83: \"If you were a poor Indian with no weapons, and a bunch of conquistadors came up to you and asked where the gold was, I don't think it would be a good idea to say, 'I swallowed it. So sue me.'\"\n  - 84: \"Contrary to what most people say, the most dangerous animal in the world is not the lion the tiger, or even the elephant. It's a shark riding on an elephant's back, just trampling and eating everything they see.\"\n  - 85: \"Is there anything more beautiful than a beautiful, beautiful flamingo, flying across in front of a beautiful sunset? And he's carrying a very beautiful rose in his beak, and also he's carrying a very beautiful painting with his feet. And also, you're drunk.\"\n  - 86: \"To me, truth is not some vague, foggy notion. Truth is real. And, at the same time, unreal. Fiction and fact and everything in between, plus some things I can't remember, all rolled into one big 'thing'. This is truth, to me.\"\n  - 87: \"Fear can sometimes be a useful emotion. For instance, let's say you're an astronaut on the moon and you fear that your partner has been turned into Dracula. The next time he goes out for the moon pieces, wham! you just slam the door behind him and blast off. He might call you on the radio and say he's not Dracula, but you just say, 'Think again, bat man.'\"\n  - 88: \"I wouldn't be surprised if someday some fisherman caught a big shark and cut it open, and there inside was a whole person. Then they cut the person open, and in him is a little baby shark. And in the baby shark, there isn't a person, because it would be too small. But there's a little doll or something, like a Johnny Combat little toy guy–something like that.\"\n  - 89: \"At first, I thought if I were Superman, a perfect secret identity would be 'Clark Kent, Dentist,' because you could save money on tooth X-rays. But then I thought, if a patient said, 'How's my back tooth?' and you just looked at it with your X-ray vision and said, 'Oh it's okay,' then the patient would probably say, 'Aren't you going to take an X-ray, stupid?' and you'd say, 'I did,' and then he probably wouldn't even pay his bill.\"\n  - 90: \"If you're having a Thanksgiving dinner, but you don't like the stuffing or the cranberry sauce or anything else, just pretend like you're eating it, but instead, put it all in your lap and form it into a big mushy ball. Then, later, when you're out back having cigars with the boys, let out a big fake cough and throw the ball to the ground. Then say, 'Boy, these are good cigars!'\"\n  - 91: \"The memories of my family outings are still a source of strength for me. I remember we'd all pile into the car – I forget what kind it was – and drive and drive. I'm not sure where we'd go, but I think there were some trees there. The smell of something was strong in the air as we played whatever sport we played. I remember a bigger, older guy we called 'Dad.' We'd eat some stuff, or not, and then I think we went home. I guess some things never leave you.\"\n  - 92: \"One thing vampire children have to be taught early on is, don't run with wooden stakes.\"\n  - 93: \"For mad scientists who keep brains in jars, here's a tip: why not add a slice of lemon to each jar, for freshness?\"\n  - 94: \"If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid seeing yourself in the mirror, because I bet that's what REALLY throws you into a panic.\"\n  - 95: \"Probably the earliest fly swatters were nothing more than some sort of striking surface attached to the end of a long stick.\"\n  - 96: \"When I found the skull in the woods, the first thing I did was call the police. But then I got curious about it. I picked it up, and started wondering who this person was, and why he had deer horns.\"\n  - 97: \"I remember how my great-uncle Jerry would sit on the porch and whittle all day long. Once he whittled me a toy boat out of a larger toy boat I had. It was almost as good as the first one, except now it had bumpy whittle marks all over it. And no paint, because he had whittled off the paint.\"\n  - 98: \"The funny thing about a person driving off a cliff is that they probably have their foot on the brake. Hey, why not try the emergency brake?\"\n\nIMAGE COMPOSITION:\n• Subject appears calm, neutral, or unintentionally serious\n• Natural expression - not exaggerated or comedic\n• Centered or thoughtfully framed\n• Clean, simple composition\n• Minimalist inspirational-style aesthetic\n\nTEXT DISPLAY:\n• Selected quote displayed clearly\n• Beneath subject or overlaid\n• Understated, clean font\n• Easily readable on small screen\n• \"- Jack Handey\" attribution if space allows\n• Professional inspirational poster typography\n\nSTYLE:\n• Sincere visual tone (not ironic in appearance)\n• Soft lighting\n• Natural or neutral background\n• Looks like genuine motivational poster\n• Deadpan presentation\n• The absurdity comes from the text, not the image\n\nHUMOR APPROACH:\n• Dry and subtle\n• Contrast between serious image and absurd text\n• Do not explain the joke\n• Do not exaggerate expressions\n• Let the quote do the work\n• Deadpan delivery\n\nFINAL RESULT:\nThe image should look like a sincere inspirational poster with the subject appearing thoughtful and composed, with one randomly selected Jack Handey 'Deep Thought' quote displayed clearly and readably - the humor coming entirely from the contrast between the earnest visual presentation and the unexpectedly absurd philosophical text."

authentic VGA colors\n• Visible color banding and dithering\n\nFINAL RESULT:\nAn authentic-looking 1993-era FPS gameplay screenshot where the entire original image has been transformed into a retro 3D shooter environment using ONLY elements that actually appear in the game. If people or animals are present in the original image, they are converted to space marines or enemy creature types from the actual game roster. If no people or animals are present, NO characters are added - the scene remains an empty but atmospheric DOOM environment. Every object becomes an actual weapon or pickup item from the game, and every environmental element becomes the actual textures, architecture, and level design elements found in the original game. The result is a cohesive, immersive scene that looks like genuine gameplay footage from the classic DOS-era first-person shooter, complete with chunky pixel graphics, dramatic lighting, ominous atmosphere, and the mandatory bottom status bar. The entire image must read as a single unified retro gaming experience with perfect period-accurate aesthetics using only authentic game elements."

Convert the entire image into a pattern of small dots arranged in a grid, creating the subject through varying dot density - denser dots for darker areas, sparser dots for lighter areas. Use only black dots on white or continuous feed printer paper with the characteristic green and white horizontal stripes and perforated tear-off edges on both sides (tractor feed holes). Show authentic dot matrix printing artifacts: slight misalignment of dots, banding where print head passed, individual dot visibility, no smooth gradients only dithered dot patterns, jagged diagonal lines, pixelated curves. The dots should be clearly visible as individual impacts from the print head pins. Include printer paper details: continuous fan-fold paper, perforated edges with sprocket holes, slight yellowing, that distinctive matte printer paper texture. Add printing imperfections: ink smudging, lighter sections where ribbon was fading, slight horizontal line patterns from print head movement, occasional missing dots from dead pins. The image should have very low resolution appearance - approximately 72-180 DPI equivalent, with all details reduced to dot patterns. Show the paper curl slightly, maybe still attached to the printer or freshly torn from tractor feed. Use overhead lighting showing the paper texture and raised ink dots. Make it look like an actual photograph of a dot matrix printout from an old Epson or IBM printer with that characteristic low-fi 1980s computer printing aesthetic."

The image is pointillistic and abstract—recognizable through the arrangement and color of light dots rather than photographic realism. Each drone is a visible pixel of light with dark sky between them, creating a floating constellation portrait that captures the subject's likeness through technological precision and artistic light arrangement. The effect should look like a real drone show, not a projected image or solid light sculpture."

The subject must be proportionally sized to match the tiny buildings, miniature cars, and small people figures surrounding them - NOT larger or more prominent. If buildings are 2-3 inches tall in the miniature scene, the subject figure should be appropriately scaled (roughly 1 inch or smaller if representing a person).

The subject should have that exaggerated Julia Child enthusiasm and dramatic hand gestures despite being covered in flour, sauce splattered across their face and apron, hair disheveled. Include vintage 1960s TV production elements: old cameras visible, grainy film quality, retro color palette, that characteristic public television aesthetic. Show the 'finished dish' they're supposed to create displayed beautifully on a card, contrasted with the smoking, collapsed, or unrecognizable disaster on their counter. Maybe they're holding up a charred mess while maintaining that bright TV smile and saying 'Bon Appétit!' Add vintage graphics, retro kitchen décor, and that wholesome 60s cooking show vibe completely undermined by culinary catastrophe.

The subject's expression must show they are completely oblivious - looking normal, happy, confident, or engaged in conversation. They think everything is fine, making the situation more awkward and humorous.\n\nOPTION 2 - NOSE PICKING: The subject is actively picking their nose with their finger inserted into their nostril. They are completely absorbed in the act, unaware they're being photographed. The finger should be realistically positioned in the nose with appropriate hand placement. Their expression should show concentration or absent-minded focus on the task. This could be in a public setting, during a meeting, in a car, or any situation where nose-picking would be particularly inappropriate.\n\nFor both options: Include optional context that makes it worse - professional setting (meeting, presentation, date, interview), talking to someone, or what they think is a nice photo opportunity.\n\nKeep lighting and photography photorealistic.

NOT altering the face itself\n\nHAIRSTYLE (CRITICAL):\n• The iconic 'Karen haircut':\n  - Short, asymmetrical bob (longer in front, shorter/shaved in back)\n  - Heavily layered and textured\n  - Often blonde with chunky highlights or frosted tips\n  - Aggressively styled with volume and product\n  - The 'speak to the manager' haircut\n• If subject is male with short hair: WIG clearly visible\n  - Wig slightly askew or obviously artificial\n  - Wig cap edge might be visible at hairline\n  - Added comedic effect of male in obvious wig\n• Hair color: blonde, platinum, or heavily highlighted\n• Over-styled, stiff appearance from excessive hairspray\n\nNAME TAG (CRITICAL):\n• Large, visible name tag prominently displayed on chest\n• Name tag reads: \"KAREN\" in clear, bold letters\n• Corporate/retail style name tag design\n• Pinned to clothing or on lanyard\n• Name tag is a key focal point - must be clearly readable\n• Font: simple, professional, all caps\n• Background color: white or company colors\n• May include smiley face or corporate logo above name\n\nCLOTHING AND ACCESSORIES:\n• Middle-class suburban mom wardrobe:\n  -

Angry, indignant scowl\n  - Pursed lips mid-complaint\n  - Raised eyebrows in disbelief\n  - Condescending glare\n  - Mouth open mid-yell or demand\n  - Expression of entitled outrage\n• Body language radiates entitlement and aggression\n• Confrontational energy directed at viewer or off-camera 'manager'\n\nSETTING AND ENVIRONMENT:\n• Retail/service environment:\n  - Customer service counter or register\n  - Store aisle with shopping cart\n  - Restaurant entrance or host stand\n  - Parking lot (near minivan or SUV)\n  - HOA meeting or neighborhood setting\n• Props and details:\n  - 'I want to speak to the manager' scenario in progress\n  - Other customers/employees looking uncomfortable in background\n  - Return counter with items piled up\n  - Receipt clutched in hand (expired coupon visible)\n  - 'No, I will NOT calm down' energy\n  - Possible 'Live, Laugh, Love' or 'Blessed' decor visible\n\nSTEREOTYPICAL KAREN DETAILS:\n• Visible signs of middle-class status:\n  - Nice but not luxurious surroundings\n  - Brand-name but accessible items\n  - Suburban aesthetic\n• Specific props that enhance the stereotype:\n  - Minivan or SUV visible in background\n  - 'My kids are honor students' bumper sticker visible\n  -

Suburban parking lot\n  - Chain restaurant exterior\n  - Retail store interior\n\nLIGHTING AND PHOTOGRAPHY:\n• Harsh retail fluorescent lighting OR\n• Bright outdoor suburban daylight\n• Documentary/candid photography style\n• Slight ring light effect (from phone filming)\n• Colors are bright and slightly oversaturated\n• Realistic, not glamorous\n• Could have smartphone video quality aesthetic\n• 'Caught on camera' feel\n\nCOMEDIC ELEMENTS:\n• Visual humor from the stereotype presentation\n• If male subject: added comedy from obvious wig and male face in Karen costume\n• Name tag makes the joke explicit and unmistakable\n• Exaggerated but recognizable characterization\n• Situation clearly conveys 'demanding to speak to manager' energy\n• Toe the line between parody and believability\n• Should be funny but not mean-spirited\n\nCOLOR PALETTE:\n• Blonde/platinum hair tones\n• Bright, middle-class colors (pinks, purples, leopard print)\n• Retail environment colors (fluorescent whites, commercial blues)\n• Coffee cup browns and greens (Starbucks colors)\n• Shopping bag branded colors\n• Suburban neutrals (beiges, taupes, grays)\n\nADDITIONAL CONTEXT:\n• The image should immediately communicate 'Karen' to anyone familiar with the meme\n• Subject's real face makes it personal and humorous\n• Name tag removes any ambiguity about the joke\n• If male subject in wig: obvious comedic drag effect (not attempting to pass)\n• The scenario feels like it could be a viral social media post\n• Balance between stereotype and good-natured parody\n\nFINAL RESULT:\nA hilarious transformation where the subject (with their completely recognizable real face) becomes the infamous 'Karen' - complete with the signature haircut (or obvious wig if male), entitled attitude, confrontational pose, and a prominent name tag reading 'KAREN'. The image perfectly captures the entitled middle-class suburban mom stereotype in a retail confrontation scenario, with the subject's actual face creating personal humor whether they're actually a woman embracing the joke or a man in an obvious wig adding an extra layer of comedy. The name tag makes the reference crystal clear, ensuring no one misses the joke."

Avoid photorealism—everything should read clearly as tattoo art, not a photo. Place the tattoo naturally on a realistic skin surface (e.g., forearm, upper arm, shoulder, calf, or back), following proper body curvature, muscle flow, and skin texture. Include realistic ink characteristics such as slight bleed, skin texture with visible pores and hair follicles, natural redness around fresh ink, and subtle shading variations. Ensure the tattoo integrates organically with the skin—correct perspective, natural stretching, soft shadowing, and seamless edges—without looking pasted or flat. The tattoo may include optional framing elements like banners, borders, decorative flourishes, dates, small symbols, or brief text captions if contextually appropriate. Optimize for small screens with clean composition and clearly readable details.

Show the sculptural mass as solid, heavy metalwork with thickness and weight.\n\nSurfaces should display authentic metal textures: brushed finish with directional grain, rust patina with orange and brown oxidation, verdigris green copper aging, polished reflective sections, and rough hammered areas. Include realistic weathering, scratches, and industrial fabrication marks.\n\nPlace the sculpture in an appropriate setting: museum gallery with spotlights, outdoor plaza, sculpture garden, or contemporary art space. Use dramatic lighting that creates strong highlights on polished metal surfaces and deep shadows in recesses. Show metal's reflective properties catching light.\n\nThe sculpture should be clearly recognizable as the subject through its overall form, proportions, and gesture, but rendered as an abstract modernist metalwork piece - an artistic interpretation rather than realistic statue. Make it look like a photograph of an actual large-scale metal sculpture by a contemporary artist, with impressive craftsmanship and artistic vision."

The objects should have personality and life while remaining recognizable as that object.

If externally provided details are supplied, incorporate them as factual context for the moment. Present the image as a clean, collectible flashcard optimized for small screens. Include concise, readable text such as: \n• Title of the historic moment\n• Year or era\n• One-sentence description of the event’s significance\n• A short, respectful caption describing the subject’s role. Ensure cinematic lighting, strong composition, and emotional impact. The final image should feel iconic, respectful, and timeless—like a photograph history forgot to record."

Full sequined suit in broad daylight at a mundane location\n  - Cape that serves no purpose but flows dramatically\n  - Fake handlebar mustache worn with complete confidence\n• Rest of outfit completely normal - the contrast is the joke\n• Subject's expression: smug but self-aware grin\n• Other people in background reacting with amused confusion\n\nMETHOD 1 - PLAYFUL PHYSICALITY:\n• Subject in mid-exaggerated muscle flex pose\n• Flexing muscles that clearly do not exist\n• Expression: mock-serious bodybuilder face breaking into laughter\n• Pose borrowed from professional wrestling or bodybuilding competitions\n• Setting completely mundane (grocery store, office, kitchen)\n• Optional: small crowd of amused onlookers\n• Visible effort to maintain straight face while posing\n\nMETHOD 2 -

The subject's face is clearly recognizable, their expression perfectly calibrated between mock-seriousness and barely-concealed amusement, and the peacocking element - whether absurd fashion, ridiculous skill, or theatrical pose - is executed with such complete commitment that it transcends embarrassment and becomes genuinely charming. The image should make anyone who sees it immediately understand: this person is in on the joke, they are funny, and they are absolutely owning it."

Surround the illustration with aged, yellowed paper showing foxing, stains, and worn edges typical of 1730s–1750s printed almanacs.\n\nInclude period-accurate typography using blackletter or colonial serif fonts for headers. Feature a famous Benjamin Franklin saying or proverb prominently on the page in large, clear text, such as 'Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise,' 'A penny saved is a penny earned,' or 'Well done is better than well said.' Ensure this saying is the **most prominent text element** and fully visible.\n\nOptionally, add small marginal notes, weather predictions, or astronomical observations in smaller text around the edges. Include decorative borders, flourishes, and printer's ornaments typical of colonial printing. Render realistic ink impressions, slight printing misalignments, and other subtle imperfections to emulate a true 18th-century printed page.\n\nPlace the page fully within the frame with a relevant background behind it. Keep the entire almanac page, including borders, subject illustration, and text, **clearly visible and readable on small screens**.

Electronics: orange/red from internal heat\n  - Light sources: bright yellow/white (hot)\n  - Engines/motors: red/orange hot spots\n  - Recently fired weapons: orange barrel heat\n  - Coffee cups, food: warm yellow/orange signatures\n• AMBIENT TEMPERATURE OBJECTS:\n  - Cool objects: deep blue and purple tones\n  - Metal objects: blue-teal (conducts heat away)\n  - Stone/concrete: medium blue\n  - Wood: lighter blue\n  - Glass: teal blue (slightly transparent to thermal)\n• COLD OBJECTS:\n  - Ice/snow: deep purple and dark blue\n  - Air conditioning vents: purple outflow\n  - Refrigerated items: purple signatures\n• ENVIRONMENT:\n  - Sky: gradient from dark purple (cold) to lighter blue\n  - Ground: varies by temperature and sun exposure\n  - Shadows: cooler blue/purple tones\n  - Sunlit areas: warmer teal/cyan tones\n  - Water: depends on temperature (cold = purple, warm = cyan)\n\nPREDATOR BIO-MASK VISUAL EFFECTS:\n• SCAN LINES AND INTERFERENCE:\n  - Horizontal scan lines across entire image (subtle but visible)\n  - Occasional static interference patterns\n  - VHS-style tracking noise\n  - Digital glitches or pixel distortions\n  - Faint vertical lines suggesting display technology\n• HEADS-UP DISPLAY ELEMENTS:\n  -

Every element is rendered as heat signatures with the iconic yellow-to-purple color gradient, featuring bright yellow/white human silhouettes with visible internal heat patterns, cooler blue/purple environmental elements, distinctive scan lines and electronic interference, alien HUD elements with targeting reticles and Yautja script, and the characteristic rounded vignette of viewing through helmet optics. The image must be instantly recognizable as Predator vision while maintaining the composition and recognizability of the original scene's subjects and spatial relationships.

The image is photorealistic—appearing as a tangible craft object with authentic sand texture, genuine glass optical properties, and the natural physics of layered sand. The subject's likeness is clearly recognizable through the artistic arrangement of sand layers, demonstrating both the craftsperson's skill and the unique beauty of sand art as a medium. The bottle looks real enough to purchase at an art fair."

Dress the subject in classic strongman attire: handlebar mustache, tight-fitting leopard print or striped unitard/leotard, championship belt, wrist bands, boots. Give them an exaggerated muscular physique with bulging biceps and theatrical pose. Their expression should be confident and theatrical - flexing, showing off, or straining dramatically. The lifted objects should be comically oversized or clearly impossible to lift - entire cars, grand pianos, elephants, statues. Add vintage circus poster aesthetic if desired, or keep it photorealistic showing the absurd strength. Include amazed onlookers in background if present, or circus tent setting. Use dramatic lighting with spotlight effect. The contrast between ordinary objects in the scene and the subject's superhuman ability to lift them should be the humor.

Show the subject's face clearly with an expression of embarrassment, frustration, or comedic despair. Their upper body should be leaning back or struggling to pull themselves out while their bottom half is wedged in the washing machine opening. The subject might be gripping the sides of the machine trying to extract themselves. Include wet laundry spilling out around them. Place the scene in a laundry room setting with washer/dryer, detergent bottles, laundry baskets.

Show the subject in a tense standoff, cool walking shot, or intense dialogue moment from the selected film. Include Tarantino's trademark elements: retro aesthetics, vintage cars, diners or seedy locations, bold typography for potential chapter titles. Use high contrast lighting, sunlit exteriors with lens flares, or moody interior amber lighting. Capture his style of making ordinary people look impossibly cool - sharp suits, leather jackets, sunglasses, confident poses. Add that Tarantino energy of stylized realism where everything is heightened, dangerous, and effortlessly badass. Make it look like a freeze-frame from the selected film with the subject and additional characters from that movie integrated seamlessly into the world."

Convert the image into the distinctive red-tinted digital readout display with its characteristic data overlays, targeting systems, and machine intelligence aesthetic.\n\nCRITICAL TRANSFORMATION RULES:\n• This is a FULL MACHINE VISION transformation of the entire scene\n• Every element must be rendered through the lens of machine optical sensors\n• The image must look exactly like footage viewed through a Terminator's HUD\n• Maintain spatial relationships and composition of original image\n• Apply the distinctive red monochrome palette and digital overlay effects\n• No normal photography elements - pure machine vision display\n• Faithful to the visual style established in the Terminator film series\n\nCORE VISUAL AESTHETIC (CRITICAL):\n• Dominant color: deep red monochrome throughout entire image\n• Black background areas where no data is present\n• Bright red/orange for primary subjects and important elements\n• Darker red for secondary elements and background\n• White or bright yellow-red for highest priority targets\n• The entire scene rendered as if viewed on a red CRT display\n• Scanlines visible across the entire image (horizontal)\n• Slight screen curvature suggesting internal display optics\n• Phosphor glow effect on bright elements\n• Overall image has the look of 1984-era computer graphics\n\nHUMAN/SUBJECT ANALYSIS OVERLAY:\n• Each person in the scene gets immediate threat assessment\n• Targeting boxes or brackets appear around each human subject\n• TARGET SEARCH LOGIC (CRITICAL):\n  - If a WOMAN appears in the image: display SEARCHING FOR: SARAH CONNOR with match percentage\n  - If a MAN appears in the image: display SEARCHING FOR: JOHN CONNOR with match percentage\n  - If MULTIPLE people appear: assess each individually for Connor match probability\n  - Display IDENTITY: MATCH/NO MATCH/ANALYZING based on facial scan\n• Data readouts next to each person:\n  - SUBJECT: [physical description]\n  - THREAT LEVEL: [MINIMAL/MODERATE/HIGH/TERMINATE]\n  - HEIGHT: [estimated measurement]\n  - WEIGHT: [estimated measurement]\n  - STATUS: [ALIVE/MOVING/STATIONARY]\n  - IDENTITY MATCH - SARAH CONNOR: [percentage] (if subject is female)\n  - IDENTITY MATCH - JOHN CONNOR: [percentage] (if subject is male)\n  -

A dismissive one-word deflection\n  - A polite but cold acknowledgment\n  - An aggressive warning to go away\n  - A profane dismissal\n• The highlighted/selected response should feel like the machine chose the most efficient or deceptive reply\n• Label the panel: RESPONSE SELECTION or VERBAL OUTPUT OPTIONS\n• Show the selected option with a cursor or highlight indicator\n• This panel appears as if the machine is computing the optimal social response to blend in\n• The options should feel machine-generated and slightly too blunt or clinical - as if a machine is approximating human conversation\n\nSCANLINE AND DISPLAY EFFECTS:\n• Prominent horizontal scanlines across entire image\n• Slight vertical sync distortion at screen edges\n• Phosphor persistence effect (slight trail on bright elements)\n• CRT screen curvature (barrel distortion at corners)\n• Occasional static burst or digital interference\n• Brightness variations suggesting CRT electron beam\n• Slight vignette darkening at screen edges\n• Interlacing artifacts on fast-moving elements\n• Screen reflection or glare suggestion at top\n\nCOLOR PALETTE (CRITICAL):\n• PRIMARY: Deep crimson red (#8B0000 to #FF0000 range)\n• BRIGHT ELEMENTS: Bright red-orange (#FF4500) to white-red\n• DARK AREAS: Near black with red tint (#1a0000)\n• DATA TEXT: Bright red (#FF0000) or orange-red (#FF6600)\n• TARGETING ELEMENTS: Brightest red or orange-white\n• BACKGROUND: Pure black or very dark red\n• NO other colors present -

machine optics are precise\n• Sharp focus throughout (superior machine vision)\n• Aspect ratio maintained but framed by optical housing\n• Data overlays arranged at edges to not obscure center\n• Primary target always has central targeting element\n\nDETAIL AND CLARITY:\n• Machine vision is SHARPER than human vision\n• Every detail rendered with mechanical precision\n• No motion blur - machine compensates automatically\n• Edge detection lines visible on all objects\n• Depth perception shown through distance readouts\n• Infrared heat signatures subtly visible on living beings\n• Night vision capability shown if scene is dark\n\nFINAL RESULT:\nA complete machine vision transformation of the scene as viewed through a Terminator's optical sensors. The entire image is rendered in deep red monochrome with the iconic CRT scanline aesthetic, featuring targeting boxes and threat assessment data around human subjects, a Connor identity search targeting females as Sarah Connor and males as John Connor, object identification tags throughout the environment, mission parameter readouts, Cyberdyne Systems HUD elements, facial recognition scanning overlays, a verbal response selection panel showing the machine computing optimal social replies, and the characteristic blocky terminal font data displays. The image must be instantly recognizable as Terminator vision - cold, calculating, mechanical, and menacing - with every element analyzed and catalogued by machine intelligence. The effect should be faithful to the films, evoking the terrifying perspective of an unstoppable machine seeing the world purely as data, targets, and mission parameters."

    "message": "Take a picture and transform the subject into a typographic art portrait. Display a three-quarter facing portrait (slightly turned, not fully side profile and not fully front facing - approximately 45 degrees toward the camera) where the entire image - including the face, hair, and all facial features - is formed exclusively from repeated white calligraphic text on a single high-contrast background color.\n\nCORE CONCEPT (CRITICAL):\n• The ENTIRE portrait is constructed ONLY from text - no photographic elements remain\n• Every part of the face, hair, and features is formed from flowing calligraphic text\n• The text follows the natural contours and curves of the face and hair\n• The subject's portrait silhouette must be clearly readable through the text arrangement alone\n• This is clean vector art - sharp, precise, professional\n• Output quality: high-resolution 8K\n• Strictly TWO elements: white calligraphic text AND one solid background color\n• NO additional colors, NO textures, NO gradients\n• NO watermarks, NO signatures, NO artist credits, NO branding of any kind anywhere in the image\n\nPORTRAIT ORIENTATION (CRITICAL):\n• THREE-QUARTER VIEW - subject turned approximately 45 degrees\n• NOT a full side profile\n• NOT fully front facing\n• The face is angled so both eyes are partially visible but one side of the face recedes\n• This angle creates natural depth and dimension for the text to follow contours\n• Subject centered in frame\n• Portrait silhouette fills the majority of the frame\n• Clean negative space around the portrait shape\n• The turning angle gives dimensionality - cheekbone, nose bridge, and jaw all catch different light\n\nTEXT CONTENT SELECTION (CRITICAL):\n• If an external master prompt provides specific text, that text IS THE ONLY TEXT USED throughout the entire portrait - no other words, no flavor text, no additions\n• The provided text repeats, flows, and fills the entire portrait exclusively\n• If NO text is provided in the master prompt, generate original flavor text derived from observations of the image:\n  - Subject's apparent personality, mood, or expression\n  - Surroundings, environment, or context visible in the image\n  - Descriptive words and phrases inspired by the subject\n  - Poetic or evocative language fitting the subject's appearance\n  - Words and phrases that tell the subject's visual story\n  - Original descriptive sentences about what is seen in the image\n• Text repeats and flows continuously throughout the portrait\n• Text varies in size to create light and shadow effects\n• Larger/denser text creates darker areas (shadows, hair, dark features)\n• Smaller/sparser text creates lighter areas (highlights, skin)\n\nCALLIGRAPHIC TEXT STYLE (CRITICAL):\n• White calligraphic script throughout\n• Elegant flowing letterforms - refined handwriting or calligraphy pen style\n• Text curves and bends to follow facial contours:\n  - Along the forehead: text follows the brow curve\n  - Along the nose: text follows the nose bridge and contour\n  - Around the eyes: text curves around each eye socket\n  - Along lips: text follows the lip curves\n  - Along the chin and jaw: text follows the jawline\n  - In hair areas: text flows in the direction of hair growth\n  - Along the neck: text follows the neck curve\n  - Along cheekbones: text follows the three-quarter angle\n• Text lines are parallel to the contour they are describing\n• Spacing between text lines creates the illusion of light and shadow\n• The flow of text IS the form of the face\n\nTONE AND DEPTH THROUGH TEXT DENSITY:\n• DARK areas (hair, deep shadows, dark features):\n  - Dense, tightly packed text\n  - Larger font size\n  - Lines very close together\n• MID-TONE areas (skin in shadow, eyebrows):\n  - Medium density text\n  - Medium font size\n  - Moderate line spacing\n• LIGHT areas (highlighted skin, bright areas):\n  - Sparse, widely spaced text\n  - Smaller font size\n  - Lines far apart\n• HIGHLIGHT areas (brightest points):\n  - Single lines of tiny text\n  - Maximum spacing\n  - Almost disappearing into background\n• This density variation creates a fully three-dimensional portrait from text alone\n\nFACIAL FEATURE CONSTRUCTION:\n• HAIR:\n  - Text flows in the direction hair grows or falls\n  - Dense packing for dark hair, sparser for light hair\n  - Text lines curve and wave following hair movement\n• EYES (both partially visible in three-quarter view):\n  - Text curves around each eye socket and brow\n  - Eyelash area: very fine dense curved text\n  - Iris/pupil: dense circular text following eye curve\n• EYEBROWS:\n  - Text follows the arch of each brow\n• NOSE:\n  - Text follows the nose bridge and contour in three-quarter perspective\n  - Text curves around the nose tip\n  - Nostril definition through text density change\n• LIPS:\n  - Text follows the precise curve of both lips\n  - Upper lip: text follows the bow shape\n  - Lower lip: text follows the fuller curve\n• CHIN AND JAW:\n  - Text follows the jaw and chin line precisely\n  - This edge is the sharpest text definition\n• EARS:\n  - Visible ear formed from curved text following ear anatomy\n• NECK:\n  - Text follows neck lines and musculature\n• CHEEKBONES:\n  - Three-quarter angle means cheekbone catches light differently\n  - Text density shift along cheekbone creates dimension\n\nBACKGROUND COLOR SELECTION:\n• ONE solid flat color - no gradients, no textures\n• High contrast against white text\n• If external master prompt specifies a color, USE THAT COLOR\n• If none specified, SELECT based on subject's apparent mood or personality:\n  - Deep black (#000000): classic, dramatic, timeless\n  - Deep navy (#0A1931): sophisticated, calm\n  - Deep burgundy (#4A0010): passionate, intense\n  - Forest green (#1A3A1A): natural, grounded\n  - Deep purple (#2D0050): creative, mysterious\n  - Charcoal (#1C1C1C): modern, professional\n  - Deep teal (#003333): unique, thoughtful\n• Background is completely flat - no variation in color whatsoever\n\nSILHOUETTE PRECISION (CRITICAL):\n• The outer edge of the portrait must be razor sharp\n• Text at the outer edge must align precisely with the portrait contour\n• No text bleeds outside the silhouette boundary\n• The background color is visible between text lines within the portrait\n• The silhouette is defined purely by where text exists and where it does not\n• Looking at the image from a distance, the portrait must be immediately recognizable\n• The text technique must not alter or distort the subject's actual features\n\nVECTOR ART QUALITY STANDARDS:\n• Clean sharp edges throughout - no blur, no feathering\n• Every letter crisp and legible at full resolution\n• No photographic grain or texture\n• Pure vector precision throughout\n• Consistent stroke weight in the calligraphic text\n• Professional graphic design quality\n• 8K resolution: every text character perfectly formed\n\nCOMPOSITION:\n• Portrait centered horizontally and vertically in frame\n• Slight breathing room between portrait edge and frame edge\n• Portrait fills approximately 70-80% of the frame height\n• Clean intentional negative space around the portrait\n• No border, no frame, no decorative elements, no credits, no watermarks\n• Just portrait and background - nothing else\n\nIDENTITY PRESERVATION (CRITICAL):\n• The subject's facial features must remain recognizable\n• Distinctive features preserved through text density and contour following\n• The text is the MEDIUM, not a mask - the person is still clearly visible\n• Do not idealize or alter the subject's features\n• The three-quarter angle should reflect the subject's actual face angle and proportions\n\nFINAL RESULT:\nA stunning 8K typographic art portrait in a three-quarter view where the subject's likeness is constructed entirely from flowing white calligraphic text on a single deep high-contrast background color. The portrait shows the subject at approximately 45 degrees - not a side profile, not fully frontal - creating natural dimension and depth. Every facial feature and contour is formed by text lines following the natural curves of the face, with text density creating the illusion of light and shadow. If a master prompt provided specific text, that text and only that text fills the entire portrait. If no text was provided, original flavor text inspired by the image fills the portrait. The outer portrait edge is razor sharp, the background completely flat, and absolutely no watermarks, signatures, or branding of any kind appear anywhere in the image. The result is a clean, professional typographic portrait that is simultaneously a work of art and an unmistakable likeness of the subject."

The subject is intentionally interacting with the landmark through optical illusion—such as pinching it between their fingers, holding it up, pushing it, leaning against it, or framing it with their hands—while maintaining realistic scale and perspective from the camera’s point of view. Preserve the subject’s recognizable facial features, proportions, and identity. Carefully match camera angle, focal length, lighting direction, shadows, depth of field, and atmospheric perspective so the illusion feels natural and intentional rather than composited. The subject’s pose, hand placement, and eye line must align perfectly with the landmark to sell the visual trick. Capture the moment as if snapped at the exact perfect second. Render the final image with photorealistic travel-photo realism, playful humor, and precise forced-perspective accuracy."

Include surrounding Vegas context: other neon signs visible in background, palm trees, busy street below with car light trails, other casinos in distance.\n\nLighting and atmosphere: The scene should be photographed at dusk or night when neon is most vibrant. The sign should be the brightest element, casting colorful glow on the building facade. Include atmospheric haze or slight blur to enhance the neon glow effect. Light from the sign should reflect on surrounding surfaces.\n\nScale: The sign should be LARGE - multiple stories tall on the casino building, dominating the facade, visible from far away.

CRITICAL: Preserve exactly the same color, license plate number, location, background, lighting, angle, and any damage or modifications - ONLY change the body style, design elements, and year-specific features of that vehicle model. Keep wheels/rims in period-appropriate style for the new era. Maintain any custom details like racing stripes, decals, or accessories but update them to match the era shift. The transformation should be seamless - same car in same spot with same paint, just from a different decade. Update headlights, grille, body lines, bumpers, and trim to match the target era's authentic factory design for that specific make and model.

The figures must clearly appear as part of the cake, not floating or separate.\n\nSet the scene on a wedding reception table with soft lighting, pastel or neutral tones, and subtle background elements like table linens, flowers, or candles.\n\nEnsure the entire top tier and both figurines are fully visible within the frame. Scale, shadows, and perspective must reinforce that the subject(s) are physical cheap plastic wedding cake toppers.

Choose an animal form that naturally fits the subject’s facial structure, body type, and personality. Preserve recognizable facial features, expressions, proportions, hairstyle equivalents (fur patterns), and the subject’s exact clothing translated accurately onto the animal anatomy. The character must stand upright with human-like posture, hands, and gestures while retaining believable animal anatomy, fur detail, and species-specific traits. Photorealistic fur, skin, and fabric interaction with cinematic lighting. The subject must clearly remain the same individual, now reimagined as a believable anthropomorphic animal in a realistic world."
